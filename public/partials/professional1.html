					<p><a href="http://www.ou.edu/ccew.html">The Center for the Creation of Economic Wealth</a> , or CCEW, is an organization based out of the University of Oklahoma whose mission is to promote the development of the Oklahoma economy. They task small teams of student interns with solving real world problems by working with both university researchers and private sector businesses and non-profits. During my time as an intern, I worked for the Software Business Accelerator team, SoBA, who specialize in entrepreneurial ventures with software technology.</p>

					<h4>CCEW SoBA Intern Fall 2014 </h4>
					<p class="lefty">During the fall of 2014 I had my first internship at CCEW as a developer for the SoBA team. We were paired with a very small tech start up from Tulsa, Oklahoma who had created a web application called Narrable. Narrable was an online story telling platform designed to better engage users by having them narrate their own stories. Narrable was already being used in schools as a more interactive version of slide show presentations based on research suggesting kids learn best when they are repeating information in their own words. One of there biggest obstacles for expanding into education technology was that younger grades, k-4th, who spend about $22 million annually on ed tech, had little access to desktop computers. However, they did find a growing number of classrooms with iPads.</p>
					<p class="lefty">My team and I were tasked with creating an Objective-C iOS application to mirror the functionality of the web application and communicate with Narrableâ€™s existing Ruby on Rails server. We used agile development and worked in 2-week sprints ended by a biweekly meeting with the CCEW directors and Narrable. My responsibilities included regularly presenting during meetings and working on native data models, since the web platforms method would not work in our format. Much of my work involved examining the Narrable APIs and building up a completely original internal schema for storing the received audio files, images, and meta-data, while being able to easily export data to send back to the server. My role was also later expanded to include writing networking code, which we did using an open source library for Objective-C called <a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking">AFNetworking.</a> After about 15 weeks and around 18,000 lines of code later, we had completed our application</p>
					<p class="lefty">Before we delivered the final source code to Narrable and completed our final presentation to CCEW, we had a few more tasks that we completed. One of which was user testing with actual 3rd grade students from a local elementary school. I was in charge of these test and was able to work with several students and observe how they used the app and listen to what they had to say about it. I quickly learned of changes we needed to make like larger buttons, less text, and minimizing the number of clicks per action. We implemented what we learned from our user testing and completed our application on time. Our final meeting was a great success and Narrable was very pleased with our work. Sadly, Narrable ran out of funding a few months later before they could begin deploying the app in schools. Their servers are no longer functional, but we still have screen shots and the source code to preserve out work.</p>

					<h4>CCEW SoBA Alumni Intern Spring 2015 </h4>
					<p class="lefty">In the spring of 2015 I was invited back to work on the first ever SoBA alumni team. This time we were working for a technology-consulting firm based out of Chicago called Dom & Tom. They wanted us to prototype a secure project management web app with an emphasis on secure file sharing. They had several clients interested in such software, and needed a working model to show off to potential customers. The application consisted of a <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> server with an <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> framework and <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> database supporting a single page application using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> to form a MEAN stack. The new interns would handle the front end and the alumni would work on the back end.</p>
