				<h4>National Instruments Summer 2016</h4>
				<p class="lefty">During the Summer of 2016 I worked full time for National Instruments as intern software developer in Austin, Texas. I placed with the systems management team during my time at NI, a group focused on optimizing the way customers interact with NI equipment and software. I worked on a team of other software engineers and one other intern to add a new feature to their upcoming web application for managing networks of computers running NI software. I worked mainly with C# and a little C++ for the web application portion of the project. My work was reviewed and found to have to be of a high enough quality to ultimately be included in their upcoming release in 2017. </p>
				<p class="lefty">During my time at NI, I worked with another intern as well as several of the team members to complete our objective. The team was already developing a web application to help customers manage their systems, and myself in the other intern would work together to expand its capabilities. Our job was to create a way for customers to manage repositories for custom NI software packages. There was already existing package manager software in use, but the current system did not interface with the web application and did not allow more than one repository. This created problems for many customers who had a diverse set of software stacks which they needed to easily switch in and out for the same system. The manager of the team communicated that this was a big issue directly communicated to them by several of their customers, so our work was very important to them. The work for the project between the other intern and myself. I would handle creating the backend software to perform the actual logic of the program, and the other intern would create the front end UI. Part of my work included working with the existing package management team to properly use their APIs to manage repository files. I created a specialized NI windows service to perform all the logic of the program as well as manage a database of the repositories and packages. All the logic was stored in this service, and it had to maintain the repositories and packages both on the database and at the individual package metadata level. I also created a thin C++ backend web service to connect http requests to the custom NI service and manage user authentication. I worked with multiple teams to manage several interconnecting pieces of software to lay a solid framework for the application, and we completed the basics functionality outlined at the beginning of the project.</p>
