				<p><a href="http://www.ou.edu/ccew.html">The Center for the Creation of Economic Wealth</a> , or CCEW, is an organization based out of the University of Oklahoma whose mission is to promote the development of the Oklahoma economy. They task small teams of student interns with solving real world problems by working with both university researchers and private sector businesses and non-profits. During my time as an intern, I worked for the Software Business Accelerator team, SoBA, who specialize in entrepreneurial ventures with software technology.</p>

				<h4>CCEW SoBA Alumni Intern Spring 2015 </h4>
					<p class="lefty">In the spring of 2015 I was invited back to work on the first ever SoBA alumni team. This time we were working for a technology-consulting firm based out of Chicago called Dom & Tom. They wanted us to prototype a secure project management web app with an emphasis on secure file sharing. They had several clients interested in such software, and needed a working model to show off to potential customers. The application consisted of a <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> server with an <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> framework and <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> database supporting a single page application using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> to form a MEAN stack. The new interns would handle the front end and the alumni would work on the back end.</p>
					<p class="lefty">The Project was given the temporary name "The Vault", but the name stuck. Part of the main idea behind the prototype was demonstrating a system where collaborating users could have varying levels of access to files in the project. This was envisioned for a situation where a company might need to also work with an outside contractor who might need access to some, but not all of a companyâ€™s sensitive data. The Alumni team divided a set of routes and a database model to each developer as their responsibility. I was in charge of all project routes and of the project database model. Since the website was a single page application, most of the API routes return data from the database in json. I also wrote a few pieces of security middleware such as a method to ensure that the user would only receive file for which they had the proper privileges.</p>
					<p class="lefty">Working with an established company like Dom & Tom meant that they had clear goals and designs that they needed fulfilled. There was less room for experimenting than my previous internship in the fall of 2014. We successfully delivered a product that met all their specifications, and last I heard, they were still further developing it into a more robust product.</p>
