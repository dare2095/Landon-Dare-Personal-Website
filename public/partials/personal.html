			In addition to the work I do professionally and for my college courses, I also like to work on the occasional side project. Sometimes a have and interesting idea I want to test out, or I want to apply something I learned in class. These can range from an afternoon curiosity, or a multiple month endeavor with other collaborators. Listed below are juts a few of these projects that I feel are worth mentioning, but feel free to ask me about any other work I do.

				<h2>Loopi</h2>
				<p class="lefty">Loopi (name is still tentative) is an iOS music collaboration application that myself and three of my close friends are developing in our spare time for several months. It came from a shared desire to continue working on mobile applications after we all had finished an internship together, but to have more creative control. Most of us musicians and naturally came up with a music based application. When completed, the application will let users send small samples of music they have created to each other called “loops”. Their friends will be able to add on and combine these loops with their own to form short original pieces of music. We hope to that the application will appeal to both casual fans music as well as serious musicians. Our has been slow since we have only been able to work on it during the weekends we can all coordinate, but we hope to have a prototype available soon.

				<h2>XKCD Mobile Comic Viewer</h2>
				<p class="left">This is a small iOS application that I built over the course of a few weeks and occasionally maintain and tweak. It started from a programming challenge from an interview I had, but I ended up enjoying the project much more than I expected. I decided to go well and beyond the project description and much greater functionality. The user may utilize this application to enjoy the XKCD comic strips in a clean format purpose built for their mobile device. It is much more efficient than going through the mobile website, and has the ability to quickly jump to any comic in the series. The image from the webpage is directly accessed through the websites open APIs, so less data is used than querying the website, while providing an easier way to inspect and resize the comic. There is also a dedicated button to open up a lightweight safari browser to explore the XKCD website if the user so desires. I made this app for myself, but the source code is freely available on my Github for anyone who wants to track my progress and stay up to date with my latest revisions.

				<h2>Elliptic Curve Project</h2>	
				<p class="lefty">The elliptic curve project, is an extension of one of my most interesting course projects that I have ever completed. I took a class on cryptography in my third year of college and quickly became fascinated by the subject. Much of our work in the course involved implementing or breaking encryption strategies we learned about in class. This particular project had to do with breaking an elliptic curve encryption system when given access to key information about its private key. The project was given with several weeks to complete, as cracking the encryption was a lengthy process. Seeing the opportunity to improve upon the suggested method of setting up the decryption system, I took it upon myself to be more creative. The same algorithm would be used, but I would take advantage of several cloud computing servers to find my solution as quick as possible, I would also have to maintain the search space across multiple instances of the program. I created the application in such a way that it could easily be deployed on a cloud server and begin working with one command. While to some this might have seemed like an unnecessary amount of work, I viewed it a fun opportunity to get better acquainted with both cloud computing and cryptography. I could have created a much more rudimentary application with less automation, but what would have been the fun I that. Some of the code is still available on my Github page as well.

		<h2>This Website</h2>
		<p class="lefty">This website is one of my favorite ongoing personal projects. I started working on this project after wanting to re-sharpen my web application and design skills. I chose to make the website a little more complicated than it needs to be, but it gives me good practice with some of my favorite technologies. I also like working to improve my web design skills, and practice some of the latest trends in web UIs. This is a single page application with a mobile first design scheme. More and more of all internet traffic is coming from mobile device, so it is good to have a website that has a compatible UI. The single page application component also saves the customer data, by only loading new information and formatting to the page. The website has a MEAN stack design with a Node backend, though I yet to need to implement the database side of the stack. The website is ever changing, so don’t be surprised if you find something new upon revisiting this site after a while. I am always open to suggestions about how to improve it as well, so feel free to contact me with constructive ideas.
